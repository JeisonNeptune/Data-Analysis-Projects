    "# How well do statistics play in discerning the final teams in the NCAA Championship?\n",
    "\n",
    "To millions of Americans, March is the most important month of the year, not just because of the changing season, but because it hosts the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. It has earned the legendary nickname \"March Madness\" for good reason. Each year, 68 teams are selected from approximately 350 Division I programs to battle in a single-elimination format. The selection process, which determines which teams get into the bracket and where they are seeded, is heavily reliant on statistics such as win-loss records, Strength of Schedule (SOS), and conference championship performance. The objective of the tournament is simple: win all your games to be crowned the national champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises a crucial question for analysts and fans alike: How effectively do statistical metrics and predictive models truly play in discerning the final teams that reach the later rounds, especially when compared to the chaotic nature of the tournament itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will be conducting analysis to find answers to following questions:\n",
    "* The 2025 season had a Final Four round consisting entirely of #1 seeds. What specific factors can be seen as trends in those teams that led to success?\n",
    "* How common is it for #1 seeds to show up in the Final Four? Elite Eight?\n",
    "* What is the most common position for different seeds to end the season at?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The 2025 NCAA Tournament presented a highly unusual outcome, with all four number 1 seeds advancing to the Final Four (Houston, Duke, Auburn, Florida). While elite teams are expected to perform well, this level of dominance necessitates a deeper look into the underlying statistics. This analysis seeks to move beyond simple win/loss records and identify the statistical traits that uniquely characterized this dominant group of four teams and differentiated them from the rest of the tournament field. By isolating their key statistical advantages, we aim to uncover the factors that drove their unprecedented run of success."

Teams with a higher turnover rate (TOR) typically exhibit lower offensive effectiveness (EFG_O), as they surrender scoring possessions. Conversely, teams with a lower turnover rate are generally more effective because they maximize their opportunities to score."

    "The t-tests conclusively confirm the visual evidence from the scatter plot. With a p-value of $0.00316$ for EFG_O and a $p$-value of $0.00247$ for TOR, the Null Hypothesis of equal means is rejected for both variables. The four elite teams are statistically different from the rest of the tournament field in both metrics. This proves that their unprecedented success was driven not by superiority in a single dimension, but by the synergistic advantage of being significantly more efficient on offense (higher EFG_O) while simultaneously being significantly more secure with the ball (lowerTOR).\""

    "# B. \"Not quite my tempo\" - Do top teams play faster or slower than less successful teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adjusted Tempo (ADJ_T) metric—which measures the estimated number of possessions per $40$ minutes—is a fundamental measure of basketball strategy, influencing everything from shot selection to substitution patterns. In a highly competitive environment like the NCAA Tournament, an elite team's control over tempo is often a weapon, forcing opponents out of their comfort zone or dictating a pace that maximizes their statistical advantages. This analysis seeks to answer a critical strategic question following the highly unusual 2025 season: Did the four most successful teams in the tournament exhibit a unified style of play, favoring a pace significantly faster or slower than the average team in the field? By comparing the ADJ_T distribution of the four elite teams to the rest of the competitive field, we aim to determine if a deliberate, controlled tempo was a shared characteristic that underpinned their unprecedented dominance."

    "Our initial comparison of the Top Four teams revealed a negligible difference in average Adjusted Tempo {ADJ_T} compared to the rest of the field, suggesting that pace of play alone was not the distinguishing factor for the tournament's most dominant group.To find a clearer statistical signature, we expanded the scope of the elite group to include the Top Eight teams, Top Sixteen and Top Thirty-Two in the 2025 dataset. This expanded analysis seeks to determine if a collective, consistent approach to tempo emerges when a larger pool of elite teams is considered, or if high-level success is instead achieved through diverse strategies."

    "# Is having a #1 Seed in the Final Four common?\n",
    "The 2025 NCAA Tournament will be etched into history for its unprecedented conclusion, featuring a Final Four round composed entirely of #1 seeds. While a #1 seed's presence in the tournament's final weekend is expected, four simultaneously advancing defies historical probability, raising questions about the unique dominance of that year's field. This analysis aims to contextualize the 2025 outcome by quantifying the historical frequency of such success. By reviewing the complete dataset of tournament results, we will establish the standard rate of #1 seeds appearing in the Final Four and the Elite Eight, providing a solid statistical baseline against which the remarkable 2025 season can be accurately measured."

    "This is a core question for understanding the predictive power and volatility of the NCAA Tournament. This analysis seeks to determine the typical endpoint for teams across all seeding levels. By cross-referencing a team's pre-tournament seed ($\\mathbf{SEED}$) with their final result ($\\mathbf{POSTSEASON}$) across all historical years, we can construct a statistical profile for each seed. This will reveal the most common fate for a $1$-seed (e.g., Sweet Sixteen), a $5$-seed (e.g., Round of 32), and a $12$-seed (e.g., Round of 64), providing a comprehensive view of the tournament's true probability landscape."

    "The analysis successfully identified the historical endpoint that defines success or failure for every seed in the NCAA Tournament. The results reveal a clear statistical expectation across three tiers of competition: the elite seeds ($\\mathbf{1}$ through $\\mathbf{4}$) are most likely to reach the Sweet Sixteen ($\\text{S}16$), signifying that failure to reach the second weekend is historically improbable for this group. The mid-tier seeds ($\\mathbf{5}$ through $\\mathbf{8}$) most commonly conclude their run in the Round of 32 ($\\text{R}32$), confirming that winning one game is their statistical norm. Finally, the lower seeds ($\\mathbf{9}$ through $\\mathbf{16}$) overwhelmingly share the most common result of the Round of 64 ($\\text{R}64$), demonstrating that a first-round exit is the expected outcome for the bottom half of the bracket."

    "# Final Thoughts\n",

    "The comprehensive analysis of historical tournament data affirms that metrics like Adjusted Offensive and Defensive Efficiency ($\\text{ADJOE}/\\text{ADJDE}$) are powerful tools that accurately define the statistical hierarchy of collegiate basketball. Our findings clearly establish the $\\text{Sweet Sixteen}$ as the historical norm for $\\mathbf{\\#1}$ seeds, while $\\text{R}32$ and $\\text{R}64$ are the expected endpoints for $\\mathbf{5}$-seeds and $\\mathbf{12}$-seeds, respectively. However, the calculation of a $1.76\\%$ compound probability for all four $\\mathbf{\\#1}$ seeds to simultaneously reach the Final Four reveals the monumental difficulty of achieving statistical perfection in a single-elimination tournament. Ultimately, the data supports the conclusion that while advanced metrics effectively quantify a team's potential and establish the statistical null hypothesis for every seed, they are perpetually subject to the immense, chaotic variance of March Madness. The 2025 season serves as a dramatic historical outlier, a powerful reminder that statistical probability defines the expected path, but the unique intensity and randomness of the tournament will always generate results that defy the most robust models.\n",
